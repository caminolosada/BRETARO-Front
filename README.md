# BRETARO

Bretaro is a Single Page Application developed with React and Redux that allows you to manage a book collection. With this application, users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on their book collection in a simple and efficient way.

## Features

- Browse the list of available books.
- Add new books to the collection.
- Update the information of existing books.
- Remove books from the collection.

## Upcoming Implementations

- Login: Users will be able to log in to their accounts to access and manage their personalized collection. Once users have logged in, they can create, edit, and delete books in their private collection, which will not be accessible to other users.
- Security measures to protect user data, such as secure password storage and secure authentication via JSON Web Tokens.
